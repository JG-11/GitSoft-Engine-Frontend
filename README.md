# Git-Soft Engine Web App
## Project URL (provisional): http://20.225.244.87:8501/
#### The backend code can be accessed through this [repository](https://github.com/Ricardo-Jaramillo/GitSoft-Engine); additional backend documentation may be found [here](http://20.225.244.87:8000/docs).

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) was implemented as the framework to turn our Python code into visual and interactive elements.

As external (not built-in) components, we used the following ones:
1. [streamlit-option-menu](https://github.com/victoryhb/streamlit-option-menu)
2. [streamlit-card](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit-card/)

The purpose of this project is allow you to get information about in what GitHub projects you are a strong developer to collaborate in, as well as a company where you may be a suitable candidate. We hope you enjoy it!
